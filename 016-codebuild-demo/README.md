# ☁️ Python APP AWS CodeBuild Demo

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Python application integrated with an
AWS CodeBuild CI pipeline. The focus is on build automation, GitHub
integration, and cost-aware cloud usage.

- Integrated GitHub repository with AWS CodeBuild
- Defined build and test phases using buildspec.yml
- Builds triggered via GitHub webhook
- Artifacts stored temporarily in S3

⚠️ All AWS resources were deleted after validation to avoid ongoing costs.
This repository contains full configuration and documentation to reproduce the pipeline.
