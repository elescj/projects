## üëì Overview
This project implements a supervised machine learning pipeline to predict load default for a retail bank. Using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, the model captures relationships between loan default and features such as amount of loan approved, amount due on the existing mortgage, current value of the property, and so on. The pipeline covers data cleaning and treatment, model training, evaluation, and insight extraction, supporting loan default prediction.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset, sourced from the MIT Applied Data Science Program, is provided in CSV format with 5,960 rows and 13 columns. Each row corresponds to an applicant profile and contains details such as amount of loan approved, amount due on the existing mortgage, current value of the property, and so on.

Each record consists of 12 input features describing the applicant profile and 1 target variable indicating whether the client is defaulted on loan.

Detailed feature descriptions are listed in the table below:

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Predicting loan defaults is important for helping lenders make smarter decisions and reduce financial risk. It‚Äôs a challenging problem because people‚Äôs financial situations and repayment behaviors are complex, influenced by factors like credit history, debt, employment, and the purpose of the loan. In this project, we use historical loan data to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an applicant will default or repay, providing practical insights to guide lending decisions.

## üíª Methodology
The following steps outline the end-to-end process used in this project:

1. **Initial Data Treatment**
   - **Data Overview**: Examined the dataset to understand variable types, identify duplicates, and assess missing values.
   - **Initial Data Treatment**: Cleaned and structured the dataset to ensure readiness for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzed the distribution of numerical and categorical variables using histograms and descriptive statistics.
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Investigated relationships between independent variables and the target by:
      - Using correlation heatmaps for numerical variables.
      - Comparing numerical variable distributions across target classes with histograms and boxplots.
      - Assessing conversion rates of categorical variables with stacked bar plots.
   - **Data Treatment**: Imputed the missing value and treated outliers.

4. **Modelling**
   - Trained **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest** models separately to forecast customer conversion.
   - Tuned **hyperparameters** to improve predictive performance and mitigate overfitting.
   - Evaluated model performance using relevant metrics and visualized the tuned results.

## üìù Results

The models were evaluated on both **training** and **test** datasets using standard classification metrics.  

- **Precision (1)**: When the model predicts a conversion, how often it is correct.  
- **Recall (1)**: Out of all actual conversions, how many were correctly identified.  
- **F1-Score (1)**: Balance between precision and recall.  
- **Accuracy**: Overall correct predictions (can be misleading if classes are imbalanced).

## üí° Insights & Recommendations

### üîé Insights
#### Best Performing Model
- The **Tuned Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** showed the best trade-off between test accuracy and recall for defaulters.  
- **Logistic Regression**, while simpler, underperformed in identifying defaults due to low recall for class 1.  

#### Feature Insights
- **Debt-to-income ratio (DEBTINC)** and its missing value flag were the most critical features, emphasizing financial stability as the key factor for defaults.  
- **Age of credit history (CLAGE)** and **property value (VALUE)** also contributed significantly.  
- Categorical features like **REASON** and **JOB** had minor effects after encoding.  

#### Overfitting Considerations
- Untuned **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** overfit the training data completely (*F1-score = 1.0*), highlighting the importance of hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Grid search tuning** improved test set generalization, balancing precision and recall.  

### ‚úÖ Recommendations
#### Model Selection
- Use **Tuned Decision Tree** or **Random Forest** for deployment to predict defaults, as they offer the best combination of recall for defaulters and overall accuracy.  

#### Feature Monitoring
- Monitor critical features like **DEBTINC** and **CLAGE** in real-time to ensure model stability.  
- Regularly update **missing value flags** to reflect changes in data collection.  

#### Future Work
- Explore ensemble techniques like **Gradient Boosting** or **XGBoost** for potentially higher predictive power.  
- Incorporate more **demographic and behavioral features** if available to improve recall for high-risk borrowers.  
- Implement **cost-sensitive learning** or **resampling strategies** to address class imbalance and reduce false negatives for defaulters.
