## üëì Overview
This project implements a **deep learning pipeline** for **classifying food images** into their respective categories. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model learns visual patterns that capture the unique characteristics of each food type, allowing it to accurately classify previously unseen (unlabeled) images.

The pipeline includes:
- **Data preprocessing and image handling**
- **Design and implementation of two CNN architectures**
- **Model training, evaluation, and performance comparison**
- **Demonstration of the best-performing model on sample images**

## üìä Dataset

The dataset for this project is sourced from the **MIT Applied Data Science Program** and is organized as follows:

- The dataset is provided in **ZIP format**, containing **training** and **test** folders.
- Each folder has **three subfolders**, each representing a **food category**.
- All images are in **JPG format**.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Classifying food categories from images is important for applications such as automated dietary tracking, restaurant menu organization, and food recommendation systems. It‚Äôs a challenging problem because food images can vary widely in appearance due to differences in presentation, lighting, angle, and portion size. In this project, we use a labeled dataset of food images to build convolutional neural network (CNN) models that classify images into their respective food categories, providing practical insights into visual recognition of foods.

## üíª Methodology
The following steps outline the end-to-end process used in this project:

1. **Data (image) Processing**
   - **Data Retrieval and Preparation**: Extract data from the ZIP file and prepare the training and test data.
   - **Data Visualization**: Randomly choose a few images and observe their potential features that may be extracted in CNN.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Label the data, split into training and test set, normalize the images, and encode the categories.

2. **Modelling**
   - Build two models with different neuron structures for comparison.
   - For each model, build the architecture, training this model, and evaluate the model accuracy and confusion matrix.
   - Run a prediction with the better model.

## üìù Results

The models were evaluated on **test** datasets using standard classification metrics.  

- **Precision (1)**: When the model predicts a conversion, how often it is correct.  
- **Recall (1)**: Out of all actual conversions, how many were correctly identified.  
- **F1-Score (1)**: Balance between precision and recall.  
- **Accuracy**: Overall correct predictions (can be misleading if classes are imbalanced).  

**Classification Report**

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0     | 0.77     | 0.65   | 0.71     | 362     |
| 1     | 0.84     | 0.87   | 0.85     | 500     |
| 2     | 0.77     | 0.89   | 0.82     | 232     |

**Accuracy:** 0.80  
**Macro Avg:** Precision: 0.79, Recall: 0.80, F1-Score: 0.79  
**Weighted Avg:** Precision: 0.80, Recall: 0.80, F1-Score: 0.80

## üí° Insights & Recommendations

### üîé Insights
In this project, we built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify food images into three categories: **Bread**, **Soup**, and **Vegetable-Fruit**.  

The model achieved an overall test accuracy of **66%**, with class-wise performance varying significantly:

- **Vegetable-Fruit**: Strong performance (F1-score 0.82), correctly classified most images.  
- **Soup**: Moderate performance (F1-score 0.72) with high recall (0.90), indicating most Soup images were correctly identified.  
- **Bread**: Weak performance (F1-score 0.35), frequently misclassified as Soup, showing challenges in distinguishing visually similar categories.  

Confusion matrix analysis confirmed that the model struggles most with **Bread vs. Soup** due to overlapping visual features or possible dataset imbalance.  

Overall, the model demonstrates moderate capability in classifying food images, performing better on distinct classes (**Vegetable-Fruit**) than on similar ones (**Bread** and **Soup**).

### ‚úÖ Recommendations
1. **Increase Data Variety and Augmentation**  
   - Add more Bread images or apply data augmentation (rotation, flipping, scaling) to reduce misclassification.

2. **Address Class Imbalance**  
   - Use class weighting or oversampling techniques to give the model more emphasis on underrepresented classes.

3. **Use Transfer Learning**  
   - Pre-trained models like **VGG16**, **ResNet**, or **EfficientNet** could improve feature extraction, especially for visually similar classes.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Experiment with different architectures, optimizers, learning rates, batch sizes, and dropout rates to improve generalization.

5. **Additional Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Consider precision-recall curves, ROC-AUC, or top-2 accuracy to better understand model performance on ambiguous cases.

6. **Deployment Considerations**  
   - For real-world use in a stock photography platform, implement a **human-in-the-loop verification** for low-confidence predictions to ensure labeling quality.
