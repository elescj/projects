## üëì Overview
This project implements a supervised machine learning pipeline to predict load default for a retail bank. Using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, the model captures relationships between loan default and features such as amount of loan approved, amount due on the existing mortgage, current value of the property, and so on. The pipeline covers data cleaning and treatment, model training, evaluation, and insight extraction, supporting loan default prediction.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset, sourced from the MIT Applied Data Science Program, is provided in CSV format with 5,960 rows and 13 columns. Each row corresponds to an applicant profile and contains details such as amount of loan approved, amount due on the existing mortgage, current value of the property, and so on.

Each record consists of 12 input features describing the applicant profile and 1 target variable indicating whether the client is defaulted on loan.

Detailed feature descriptions are listed in the table below:
| Column      | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
High customer conversion‚Äîessentially identifying the right leads and approaching them effectively‚Äîis always a priority for any company. After all, no one wants to sell a fan to Eskimos; the real goal is to personalize the approach and focus on customers who truly need the product, such as residents in hot climates. Interpreting lead profiles is therefore a crucial business skill, as it enables forecasting which customers are most likely to convert and how to engage less likely customers through tailored strategies. The key to successful interpretation lies in understanding the importance of each lead profile attribute (feature) across a large dataset. The true challenge, however, is determining which model delivers the best performance.

## üíª Methodology
The following steps outline the end-to-end process used in this project:

1. **Initial Data Treatment**
   - **Data Overview**: Examined the dataset to understand variable types, identify duplicates, and assess missing values.
   - **Initial Data Treatment**: Cleaned and structured the dataset to ensure readiness for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzed the distribution of numerical and categorical variables using histograms and descriptive statistics.
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Investigated relationships between independent variables and the target by:
      - Using correlation heatmaps for numerical variables.
      - Comparing numerical variable distributions across target classes with histograms and boxplots.
      - Assessing conversion rates of categorical variables with stacked bar plots.

4. **Modelling**
   - Trained **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models separately to forecast customer conversion.
   - Tuned **hyperparameters** to improve predictive performance and mitigate overfitting.
   - Evaluated model performance using relevant metrics and visualized the tuned results.

## üìù Results

The models were evaluated on both **training** and **test** datasets using standard classification metrics.  

- **Precision (1)**: When the model predicts a conversion, how often it is correct.  
- **Recall (1)**: Out of all actual conversions, how many were correctly identified.  
- **F1-Score (1)**: Balance between precision and recall.  
- **Accuracy**: Overall correct predictions (can be misleading if classes are imbalanced).

## üí° Insights & Recommendations

### üîé Insights
- **Random Forest outperforms Decision Tree** across all metrics on the test set, confirming that the ensemble approach reduces overfitting and improves generalization.  
- Both models achieve **strong recall for conversions (class 1)** ‚Äî 0.86 (Decision Tree) and 0.85 (Random Forest). This means they capture most actual customers, which is valuable for minimizing missed opportunities.  
- **Precision for conversions is lower** (0.62 DT, 0.68 RF), indicating that a non-trivial number of non-converting leads are still predicted as converters. This could result in sales effort being spent on weaker leads. 
- **Accuracy** is higher for Random Forest (0.83 vs. 0.80), showing a better balance between identifying converters and non-converters.  
- **Business takeaway**: If the goal is to **maximize conversion opportunities**, Random Forest is preferred, as it maintains high recall while offering better precision than Decision Tree.

### ‚úÖ Recommendations
- **Deploy Random Forest as the primary model** for predicting customer conversions, as it provides higher accuracy, better precision, and strong recall compared to Decision Tree.  
- **Prioritize leads flagged as high probability converters** by the model, while acknowledging that some false positives may occur.  
- **Consider further feature engineering or additional data sources** to improve precision, reducing unnecessary sales effort on unlikely conversions.  
- **Regularly retrain the model** with new lead data to maintain performance over time, especially as customer behavior evolves.  
- **Use model insights for personalized sales strategies**, focusing efforts on leads with high predicted conversion probabilities and tailoring engagement based on lead profile attributes.
