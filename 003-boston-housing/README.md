## üß† Overview
This project implements a supervised machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices in the Boston metropolitan area, leveraging linear regression to model the relationship between property prices and a range of features such as crime rate, room count, and highway access.

## üìä Dataset
This dataset was originally provided as part of the *Applied Data Science Program* by MIT. The dataset is a **506 √ó 13** CSV file, where each row represents a residential property in a suburb or town of Boston. It was originally drawn from the **Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970**.

Each record includes **13 input features** describing property and neighborhood characteristics, and one **target variable**: the median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s).

Detailed feature descriptions are listed in the table below:
| Feature   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CRIM`    | Per capita crime rate by town                                               |
| `ZN`      | Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.           |
| `INDUS`   | Proportion of non-retail business acres per town                            |
| `CHAS`    | Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)       |
| `NOX`     | Nitric Oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)                          |
| `RM`      | The average number of rooms per dwelling                                    |
| `AGE`     | Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940                        |
| `DIS`     | Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers                        |
| `RAD`     | Index of accessibility to radial highways                                   |
| `TAX`     | Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000                                    |
| `PTRATIO` | Pupil-teacher ratio by town                                                 |
| `LSTAT`   | Percentage of lower status population                                       |
| `MEDV`    | Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable)            |

üìå Note: The Boston Housing dataset has been deprecated in newer versions of scikit-learn due to ethical concerns about the LSTAT variable. It is used here solely for educational purposes.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Accurately estimating housing prices is a persistent challenge due to the numerous and often interrelated factors that influence real estate markets ‚Äî particularly the issue of multicollinearity among predictors. This project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict housing prices in Boston using key features from the dataset. The objective is to minimize prediction error while identifying the most influential variables, offering a foundational, interpretable baseline for housing price modeling and further machine learning applications.

## üîé Methodology
The following steps outline the end-to-end process used in this project:

1. **Data Overview**  
   The Boston Housing dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for preliminary inspection. Key characteristics such as data dimensions, data types, presence of duplicates or null values, and the number of unique values per feature were assessed.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Univariate analysis** was conducted to understand the distribution of each feature using histograms and descriptive statistics.  
   - **Bivariate analysis** explored relationships between independent variables and the target (`MEDV`) using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps, helping to identify potential multicollinearity and feature relevance.

4. **Model Building ‚Äì Linear Regression**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80/20).  
   - Examined multicollinearity using correlation matrices and VIF; dropped highly collinear features.  
   - Built an initial linear regression model and evaluated coefficient significance.  
   - Removed statistically insignificant variables to improve model interpretability and re-fit the model.  
   - Verified linear regression assumptions (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, independence).  
   - Evaluated model performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.  
   - Applied **k-fold cross-validation** to assess model generalizability.  
   - Constructed the final linear regression model based on refined features and evaluation metrics.

## üìà Results

### üî¢ Model Performance Metrics
The linear regression model was evaluated using standard regression metrics on the test set:
| Metric                                    | Value             |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)   | 0.729 (+/- 0.232) |
| RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)            | 0.198045          |
| MAE (Mean Absolute Error)                 | 0.151284          |
| MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)     | 5.257965          |

These results indicate that the model explains approximately 73% of the variance in housing prices and achieves a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 5.26%.

| CHAS      | +0.1198     | Proximity to Charles River slightly increases price   |
| NOX       | -1.0562     | Higher air pollution (NOx) strongly decreases price   |
| RM        | +0.0589     | More rooms per dwelling increases price               |
| DIS       | -0.0441     | Greater distance from employment centers reduces value|
| RAD       | +0.0078     | Higher accessibility to highways slightly increases price |
| PTRATIO   | -0.0485     | Higher student‚Äìteacher ratio reduces price            |
| LSTAT     | -0.0293     | Higher % of lower status population decreases price   |

*Note: The magnitude and sign of coefficients indicate each feature‚Äôs relative impact.*

### üß™ Residual Analysis
To assess the model assumptions and quality of fit, the following plots were analyzed:
- ‚úÖ **Residuals vs. Fitted Values** (for linearity & homoscedasticity)
- ‚úÖ **Histogram of Residuals** (for normality)
- ‚úÖ **QQ Plot** (for distribution shape)
- ‚úÖ **Actual vs. Predicted** plot (for overall fit)

![Residuals vs. Fitted Values](attachments/residual.png)
![Histogram of Residuals](attachments/histogram.png)
![QQ Plot](attachments/qq-plot.png)

**Example code (matplotlib)**
```python
# Plot histogram of residuals.
sns.histplot(residuals, kde=True)
# Show the plot.
plt.show()
# Plot q-q plot of residuals
stats.probplot(residuals, dist = "norm", plot = pylab)
# Show the plot.
plt.show()
```
